          <p> Project D(ai)abetes is a project that I've been dreaming of building since I had an epiphany in my
          integral calculus class a few years ago. At the time, I didn't know enough about AI and its capabilities, but
          having finished my education and gained an understanding of recent LLM technology, it's finally coming to fruition.
          This project aims to combine the emergent features of Large Language Models alongside more classical AI methods to
          create a tool that democratizes diabetes care.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This is an entirely experimental project, and will constantly be a work in progress. It is maintained by myself,
          a single CompSci graduate living with Type 1 Diabetes for the past 15 years. While I may not have the formal medical knowledge,
          I believe in the power of experiential knowledge gained after a decade and a half of living with this condition, and of similar knowledge disseminated
            by my peers that also have a vast amount of diabetes experience. The custom
            dataset used to train the model has been personally hand-crafted, including both formal medical literature, open-source information,
          and personal knowledge. The idea is to make this project as open-source as possible, allowing other people living with diabetes
          to contribute to the dataset with their own experiential knowledge (future feature).</p>
          <br>
          <p>At the same time, I am building this because I believe that AI is one of the best solutions for diabetes therapy.
          The architecture behind this project will constantly change and be improved upon in order to help people with diabetes
          efficiently and effectively.</p>
